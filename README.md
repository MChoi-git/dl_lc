# Description
Repository containing implementations of various basic algorithms in Python.
The implementation of these algorithms are based on the MIT 6.006 class.
Additionally, there are implementations of ML/DL-specific algorithms like
basic linear regression and Attention in various DSLs like PyTorch or JAX.
